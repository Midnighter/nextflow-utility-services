# Nextflow Utility Services

A collection of custom Groovy service classes intended for use in nextflow pipelines.

| Service                        | Demo                                        | Description                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/FormattingService.groovy` | `nextflow run formatting.nf -dump-channels` | Format objects as JSON for pretty printing. |

## Usage

If you intend to use one or more of the classes from this repository. Simply copy them from the [`lib`](lib) directory to your pipeline's `lib` directory. Some classes additionally require assets which you should similarly copy from the [`assets`](assets) directory to your pipeline's `assets` directory.

If you want to use a service inside one of your modules, rather than in the main workflow, you may have to import it by its class name.

```nextflow
import Service
```
